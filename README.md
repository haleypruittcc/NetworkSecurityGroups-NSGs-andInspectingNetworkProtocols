<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
When virtual machines are created, they are given an IP address. As they boot up, each virtual machine (VM) that you deploy into a virtual network or subnet receives an IP address. In this tutorial, we use Wireshark to monitor a variety of network traffic going to and coming from Azure Virtual Machines and we practice using Network Security Groups. <br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04



<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine </h3>

 - First, you going to create your Resource Group. 
   - If you don't know how to click [here](https://github.com/haleypruittcc/ResourcegroupandHelloworld) before you continue with this section. 
- Second, type " Virtual Mahcine" on the top of the search bar and click on "Create".
- Choose you're existing "Resource Group", then choose the name of chose for your Virtual Mahcine.
- Then choose your region in your area, next you're going select "Windows 10 Pro" on Image.
- Next, select what size of your performance on you're remote desktop windows. Note: Make sure you look at your prices before you select so you won't use all your free credits up.
- Next, you're going to create your username and password by chose.
- Finally, Click on " Review and Create" and click on " Create". 
- Now you're going to do the repeat the same step but change your "Image" to "Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS" on your second Virtaul Machine.
   
 ðŸŽ‰Congratulations! You have created your first Virtual Mahcine within Azure!ðŸŽ‰
  
  <h3>Step 2: Observe the Vitual Machine within Network Watcher </h3>

</p>
<p>
  
- First, type "Network Watcher" on the search bar on top and click on "Topology" and observe the Virtual Machines connected.
  - Note: If the error said " No Network watcher present in this subscription" on the topology then follow this instrictions.
- Click on " Overview" and click on three dots on the "NetworkWatcher_eastus".
- Next, click on "Move" besides the Resource Group.
- Then, select the resource group you created on the last step and click on "Next", after its checking the resources to make sure it can move then click "Move".
- Finally, after the resources move to the subscription go back to the Network Watcher Topology and observe the connections traffic .

   
   <h3>Step 3: Observe the ICMP Traffic </h3>

- First, go to your VM01 and copy the pubic IP address. 
- Open your "Remote Desktop" on your computer and paste your public IP address and click "Connect".
- Then, type in  the sames username and password you create earlier in the last step on your VM01.
- Next, Open your Chrome or Internet browser in your remote desktop and type "Wireshark 64 bite" and install it.
- Open "Wireshark" and filter on the top bar ICMP traffic only.
- Go back to your orginal computer and go to your VMO2 copy or remember the private IP address.
- Go back to your VMO1 remote desktop and open your command line attempt to ping it. Example: "ping 10.0.0.5" 
   - Observe ping requests and replies within Wireshark.
- Now open your Powershell and attempt to ping a public website. Example:"ping www.google.com -4) 
- Next ping your VM02  private IP address for the non-stop traffic. Example " ping 10.0.0.5 -t"
  - Observe the traffic in Wireshark .
- Now we going to initiate a perpetual/non-stop ping from VM01 to VM02 
- First, go back to your orignal computer and open Network Security Group by going to your VM02 and click on "Networking" and click on " Add inbound port rule".
- Second, Select "Any" on source > Select "Any" on destination > Select "Custom" on service > Select "ICMP" on protcol > Select "Deny" on action > Type "210" on priority > on name type "Deny_ICMP_Ping_From_Anywhere" > Now click "Add".
 - Now go back to your VM01 remote desktop and observe the ICMP traffic in Wireshark and the commmand line ping activity.
- Go back to your orginal computer and re-eable ICMP traffic in your VM02 Network Security Group by click "Allow" and refresh it.
- Go back to your VM01 and observe the ICMP traffic in Wireshark and the commmand ling ping activity
- To stop ping activity press control key + c .
 
 
 <h3>Step 4: Observe the SSH Traffic </h3> 
 
 <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vQpE5Hy.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
  
 
- First, go to the Wireshark in VM01 and refresh and filter "SSH" traffic only.
- Second, go to your Powershell and type ssh your username @ VM02 private IP address and press enter. 
  - For Example:"ssh hpruittcc@10.0.0.5"
- When the question pop up on the command to be continue connecting , type "yes" and press eneter.
- Next, it going to ask for the your password, the password is the same one your created in your VM02, enter your password and press enter.
  - Note: When you enter your password it won't show up so please enter your password correctly.
- Now you're are in VM02. Type command (ls,pwd,etc) into the linux (VM02) SSH connection 
  - Observe SSH traffic spam in Wireshark.
- Finally, exit the SSH connection by typing "exit" and press enter.
 
 
 <h3>Step 5: Observe the DHCP Traffic </h3> 
 
 <p>

</p>
<p>
 
- First, go back in Wireshark and refresh , filter "DHCP" traffic only.
- Next, attempt to issue your VM a new IP address from the command line , type (ipconfig/renew)
  - Obsereve the DHCP traffic appearing in Wireshark.
   
   <h3>Step 6: Observe the DNS Traffic </h3>
  
   <p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ZxpDFs.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>

- First, go back to Wireshark and refresh, filter for "DNS" traffic only.
- Second, go to the commmand line and type "nslookup www.google.com" or "nslookup www.disney.com" to see what are their IP adresses are.
  - Obserev the DNS traffic being show in Wireshark.
   
  <h3>Step 7: Observe the RDP Traffic </h3> 
  
   
   <p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HoQjS1n.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
   
- First, back in Wireshark filter (tcp.port==3389) for RDP traffic only and press enter.
  - Question:  Before you press enetr , Will this traffic will spam non- stop or go blank or etc? 
   - Observe the immadiate non-stop spam of traffic, because the RDP (protocol) is constantly showing you a live stream from one computer to another , therefore traffic is always being transmitted.
